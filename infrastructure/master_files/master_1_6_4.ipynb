    "In most of this chapter's content so far, we've focused on dividing up LLM computation into small steps, specifically single-token generation. We saw this in Indirect Object Identification where we deeply analyzed how GPT2-Small generates a single token, and we can also see it in other exercises like OthelloGPT. But recent models have made advances in **chain-of-thought reasoning**. When models are producing very long reasoning traces (autoregressively consuming their tokens), we have to think about not just serialized computation over layers to produce a single token, but serialized computation over a very large number of tokens. To get traction on this problem, we're going to need to introduce a new abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper [Thought Anchors: Which LLM Reasoning Steps Matter?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19143) does this by splitting up reasoning traces by **sentence**. Compared to tokens, sentences are more coherent and correspond more closely to the actual reasoning steps taken by LLMs (e.g. see the paper [Understanding Reasoning in Thinking LMs via Steering Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19143), which identified behaviour categories for steps taken by reasoning models, and found them to correspond to sentences rather than tokens).\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below illustrates this: we can group sentences according to a rough taxonomy of reasoning steps, and use this to show that certain kinds of sentences are more important than others in terms of shaping the trajectory of the reasoning trace (and the final answer). The authors term these sentences **thought anchors**. Thought anchors can be identified using black-box methods (i.e. resampling rollouts) or white-box methods (looking at / intervening on attention patterns). In these exercises, we'll work through both.\n",

    "> * Learn how we can filter for low cosine similarity resamplings to find sentences which are critical for shaping the model's reasoning trajectory\n",
    "> * Reproduce several of the paper's key figures analysing the importance of different categories of reasoning steps\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Problem Setup**: Parsing or rephrasing the problem\n",
    "2. **Plan Generation**: Stating or deciding on a plan of action, meta-reasoning\n",
    "3. **Fact Retrieval**: Recalling facts, formulas, problem details\n",
    "4. **Active Computation**: Algebra, calculations, manipulations\n",
    "5. **Uncertainty Management**: Expressing confusion, re-evaluating, backtracking\n",
    "6. **Result Consolidation**: Aggregating intermediate results, summarizing\n",
    "7. **Self Checking**: Verifying previous steps, checking calculations\n",
    "8. **Final Answer Emission**: Explicitly stating the final answer\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll implement a heuristic-based approach. You should do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fill out the `CATEGORY_WORDS` dictionary below, which maps each category to a list of words associated with that category. To get you started, we've filled out the first three categories.\n",
    "- Fill out the `categorize_sentences_heuristic` function below, which uses this dictionary to categorize sentences. We've given you a few example sentences to test your function - at minimum make sure your function works for these.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've passed the test sentences below, you should try taking rollouts from your model above (or examples from the dataset) and see how your function performs on them. Some questions you might ask yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do you think this taxonomy is reasonable?\n",
    "- Are there any sentences that are misclassified, or belong to more than one category?\n",
    "- How many words do you need to add before your classification works decently?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that no heuristic-based classification will be perfect. The point of this exercise is to get you thinking about the different categories, and what the strengths / limitations of this kind of method are. In research, you should generally try not to reach for a tool more complicated than what you need!"

    "\n",
    "**1. Forced Answer Importance**. For each sentence $S_i$ in the CoT, we interrupt the model and append text, inducing a final output: `Therefore, the final answer is \\\\boxed{...}`. We then measure the model's accuracy when forced to answer immediately. If $A^f_i$ is the final answer when we force the model to answer immediately after $S_i$, and $P(A)$ is the probability of answer $A$ being correct, then the formula for forced answer importance is:\n",

    "<summary>Can you see a flaw in this approach, when it comes to identifying sentences which are critical for the model's reasoning process? Click here to reveal the answer.</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some sentence $S$ might be necessary for the final answer, but comes late in the reasoning process, meaning all sentences before $S$ will result in low accuracy by this metric. We will only pick up sentences whose inclusion *in combination with all previous sentences* gets us from the wrong answer to the right one.\n",
    "\n",
    "For people who have completed the IOI material / done much work with model internals, this is the equivalent of finding the most important model components by seeing which ones write the final answer to the residual stream. It's a good start, but doesn't tell you much about the steps of the computation beyond the last one.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Resampling Importance**. To address the flaw above, for each sentence $S_i$ in the CoT, we can resample a whole trajectory $(S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{i-1}, S_i, S'_{i+1}, ..., S'_N, A^r_i)$ (where $A^r_i$ is the final answer we get from resampling chunks after $S_i$). By comparing it to the corresponding trajectory $(S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S'_i, ..., S'_{N}, A^r_i)$ which we get from resampling chunks including $S_i$, we can get a sense for how important $S_i$ was for producing the final answer.

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Counterfactual Importance**. An issue with resampling importance is that often $S'_i$ will be very similar to $S_i$, if the reasoning context strongly constraints what can be expressed at that position. To fix this, we can filter for cases where these two sentences are fairly different, using a semantic similarity metric derived from our embedding model. This gives us a counterfactual importance metric which is identical to the previous one, but just with filtered rollouts:\n",

If you want to fix this, you can try using our `split_solution_into_chunks` function from earlier to process the resampled chunks before plotting them.

    "Finally, we'll implement **counterfactual importance**. This is the same as the resampling importance (and we'll use the same data), but with one difference: we filter out all resampled rollouts where the first resampled chunk $T_i$ is sufficiently different from the chunk $S_i$ which it replaces. In this case, sufficiently different means having an **embedding cosine similarity of less than 0.8**, using our embedding model from earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition for this metric: if resampling importance told us the effect when we choose a different sentence than $S_i$, then counterfactual importance tells us the effect when we **choose a different reasoning path than represented by $S_i$**. Low cosine similarity in this case is a proxy for the reasoning paths being very different (rather than just light rephrasings of what is essentially the same reasoning step)."

    "### Exercise - replicate Figure 3b (with KL divergence)\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪\n",
    "Importance: 🔵⚪⚪⚪⚪\n",
    "\n",
    "You should spend up to 10-30 minutes on this exercise, if you choose to complete it.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can try to replicate this figure using KL divergence instead of accuracy!\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've only been working with accuracy, i.e. how much does the model's tendency to say the correct answer change when we resample a particular chunk. But if we care about **how much a sentence shapes the model's trajectory** rather than just how much it helps the model get to the correct answer, then it makes sense to look at an absolute measure of how much the answers change. KL divergence is the perfect tool for looking at the difference between two distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cells below, you should rewrite the `calculate_counterfactual_answer_importance` function to use KL divergence instead of accuracy. In other words, the `i`-th output of your function should be the KL div between the distribution of answers when the `i`-th and `i-1`-th chunks are removed: $D(p(A^c_i) \\,||\\, p(A^c_{i-1}))$. Some notes on this:\n",
    "  \n",
    "- When computing the KL divergence, your distributions can be over the discrete set of answers produced by resamplings at either the `i`-th or `i-1`-th chunk.\n",
    "- To avoid division-by-zero errors, you should use the paper's method of **Laplace smoothing**: we add some value `alpha` to all the answer counts, so that when we convert them to distributions none of them are zero. The terms in our KL div calculation change from $p \\log \\frac{p}{q}$ to $p \\log \\frac{p'}{q'}$ where $p', q'$ are the smoothed distributions (meaning the terms will still be zero when $p$ is zero). We've given you the `alpha` parameter in the function signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can generate the same scatter plot as above, and see if the results more closely match Figure 3b from the paper. You can also regenerate the plot from the previous exercise, and compare the two metrics (KL div based vs accuracy based). Do you see any differences? \n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Answer - what you should expect to see</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "In my implementation, the two scatter plots look almost identical (although obviously the axis is different since all KL divergence values are non-negative*). \n",
    "\n",
    "The line plot was also quite similar, the main difference being that the KL divergence based metric was less noisy, i.e. more separation between the large metric spikes and the smaller values. This makes sense, since KL divergence is a convex function: an increase in the difference between two probability distributions will lead to a greater than proportional increase in the KL divergence. For example, the difference between the KL divergence of the two distributions `(0.5, 0.5)` and `(0.1, 0.9)` is more than twice the difference between `(0.5, 0.5)` and `(0.3, 0.7)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Technically they can be negative thanks to the Laplace smoothing, but only very close to zero, and the group means will all be positive.\n",

0110\",\"active_computation\"],[\"6 is 0110 6 is 0110\",\"active_computation\"],[\"6 is 0110 6 is 0110\",\"active_computation\"],[\"So, putting them together, we
