Well, for any given input, and any 2 latents in different layers, we can compute the derivative of the second latent's activation with respect to the first latent. This takes the form of a matrix of partial derivatives, i.e. $J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j}$, and can serve as a linear proxy for how latents in an early layer contribute to latents in a later layer.

The answer is that we'll be multiplying the model's embeddings by some scale factor `s` (i.e. a vector of different scale factor values for each token in our sequence), and taking the gradient of the SAE's latents wrt these values `s`, evaluated at `s = [1, 1, ..., 1]`. This isn't super principled since in practice this kind of embedding vector scaling doesn't happen in our model, but it's a convenient way to get a sense of **which tokens are most important for which latents**.\n", "\n", "Challenge - take the pair of latents from the previous exercise which seemed to form a circuit on bigrams consisting of tokenized words where the first token is `\" E\"`.

Well, one obvious answer is that it completes our end-to-end circuits picture (we've now got tokens -> latents -> other latents -> logits). But to give another answer, we can consider latents as having a dual nature: when looking back towards the input, they are **representations**, but when looking forward towards the logits, they are **actions**. We might expect sparsity in both directions, in other words not only should latents sparsely represent the activations produced by the input, they should also sparsely affect the gradients influencing the output. As you'll see when doing these exercises, this is partially the case, although not to the same degree as we saw extremely sparse token-to-latent or latent-to-latent gradients. One reason for that is that sparsity as representations is already included in the SAE's loss function (the L1 penalty), but there's no explicit penalty term to encourage sparsity in the latent gradients.

In fact, we could only compute gradients between latents which were both alive in the same forward pass. One way we might have liked to deal with this is by just taking the dot product of the \"writing vector\" of one latent with the \"reading vector\" of another. For example, suppose our SAEs were trained on post-ReLU MLP activations, then we could compute: `W_dec[:, f1] @ W_out[layer1] @ W_in[layer2] @ W_enc[f2, :]` (where `f1` and `f2` are our earlier and later latent indices, `layer1` and `layer2` are our SAE layers, and `W_in`, `W_out` are the MLP input & output weight matrices for all layers). To make sense of this formula: the term `W_dec[:, f1] @ W_out[layer1]` is the \"writing vector\" being added to the residual stream by the first (earlier) latent, and we would take the dot product of this with `W_in[layer2] @ W_enc[f2, :]` to compute the activation of the second (later) latent. However, one slight frustration is that we're ignoring the later MLP layer's ReLU function (remember that the SAEs are reconstructing the post-ReLU activations, not pre-ReLU). This might seem like a minor point, but it actually gets to a core part of the limitation of standard SAEs when trained on layers which perform computation - **the SAEs are reconstructing a snapshot in the model, but they're not helping us get insight into the layer's actual computation process**.\n", "\n", "How do transcoders help us here? Well, since transcoders sit around the entire MLP layer (nonlinearity and all), we can literally compute the dot product between the \"writing vector\" and a downstream \"reading vector\" to figure out whether any given latent causes another one to be activated (ignoring layernorm). To make a few definitions:\n", "\n", "- The **pullback** of some later latent is $p = (W_{dec})^T f_{later}$, i.e. the dot product of the later latent vector (reading weight) with all the decoder weights (writing weights) of earlier latents.\n", "- The **de-embedding** is a special case: $d = W_E f_{later}$, i.e. instead of asking \"which earlier transcoder latents activate some later latent?\" we ask \"which tokens maximally activate some later latent?\".\n", "\n", "Note that we can in principle compute both of these quantities for regular MLP SAEs. But they wouldn't be as accurate to the model's actual computation, and so you couldn't draw as many strong conclusions from them.\n", "\n", "To complete our circuit picture of (embeddings -> transcoders -> unembeddings), it's worth noting that we can compute the logit lens for a transcoder latent in exactly the same way as regular SAEs: just take the dot product of the transcoder decoder vector with the unembedding matrix. Since this has basically the exact same justification & interpretation as for regular SAEs, we don't need to invent a new term for it, so we'll just keep calling it the logit lens!"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["### Exercise - compute de-embedding\n", "\n", "> ```yaml\n", "> Difficulty: \ud83d\udd34\u26aa\u26aa\u26aa\u26aa\n", "> Importance: \ud83d\udd35\ud83d\udd35\ud83d\udd35\u26aa\u26aa\n", "> \n", "> You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.\n", "> ```\n", "\n", "In the cell below, you should compute the de-embedding for this latent (i.e. which tokens cause this latent to fire most strongly).

In other words, it tells you not just which earlier latents would affect some later latent when those earlier latents fire, but which ones *do* affect the later latent on some particular input (i.e. taking into account which ones actually fired).\n", "\n", "What's the motivation for this? Well, eventually we want to be able to understand latents when they appear in complex circuits, not just as individual units which respond to specific latents in the data. And part of that should involve being able to build up hypotheses about what a given latent is doing based on only its connection to other latents (or to specific tokens in the input). Just looking directly at the top activating examples can definitely be helpful, but not only is it sometimes [misleading](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3zBsxeZzd3cvuueMJ/paper-a-is-for-absorption-studying-latent-splitting-and), it also can only tell you *what* a latent is doing, without giving much insight into *why*.\n", "\n", "To be clear on the rules:\n", "\n", "- You can't look at activations of a latent on specific tokens in specific example prompts.\n", "- You can use input-dependent analysis e.g. the influence of some earlier latents on your target latent on some particular input (however you have to keep the input in terms of token IDs not tokens, because it's cheating to look at the actual content of prompts which activate any of your latents).\n", "- You can use input-indepenent analysis e.g. a latent's de-embeddings or logit lens.\n", "\n", "We're making this a very open-ended exercise - we've written some functions for you above, but others you might have to write yourself, depending on what seems most useful for your analysis (e.g. we've not given you a function to compute pullback yet). If you want an easier exercise then you can use a latent which the post successfully reverse-engineered (e.g. latent 355, the 300th live latent in the transcoder), but for a challenge you can also try latent 479 (the 400th live latent in the transcoder,which the authors weren't able to reverse-engineer in their initial post).\n", "\n", "If you want a slightly easier version of the game, you can try a rule relaxation where you're allowed to pass your own sequences into the model to test hypotheses (you just can't do something like find the top activating sequences over a large dataset and decode them).
